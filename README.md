🚀 Future Improvements

Add different difficulty modes (easy, medium, hard).
Add background music and small sound effects.
Add a pause menu and basic settings.
Add simple animations like moving clouds or apple splash.
Make the apple–basket collision more accurate.
Add small power-ups like slow motion or double points.
Clean and organize the code to make it easier to update later.
Add a basic level system or small achievements.
