🎮 Catch the Apple – Python Game

A 2D interactive game built using Python and Pygame, designed to demonstrate real-time object movement, collision detection, and score tracking. This project showcases fundamental game development concepts and Python logic implementation.

🔥 Features

Main menu with Play and Quit buttons

Falling apples that rotate and move slightly sideways

Basket that the player moves left and right

Score system that increases when an apple is caught

Lives system (you lose a life when an apple hits the ground)

Game Over screen with score, high score, and restart option

High score is saved in a file

Smooth falling physics (gravity, speed increase, terminal velocity)

Multiple apples falling at the same time

Simple background with sky and grass

Auto-respawn of apples at random positions

Restart game with the R key

Exit to main menu with the ESC key

Basic collision detection between apple and basket

🚀 Future Improvements

Add different difficulty modes (easy, medium, hard).

Add background music and small sound effects.

Add a pause menu and basic settings.

Add simple animations like moving clouds or apple splash.

Make the apple–basket collision more accurate.

Add small power-ups like slow motion or double points.

Clean and organize the code to make it easier to update later.

Add a basic level system or small achievements.
